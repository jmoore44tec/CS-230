This repository is a collection of my work for the fictional client "The Gaming Room"
Scenario -
You work for Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) as a Technology Consultant. First, you introduced your client, The Gaming Room, to different approaches they can use as they expand their game onto various operating systems. You then explained the integration of the client’s game in a distributed environment. Now, you will explain how to apply the client’s needs to the architectures of the different operating platforms available.

My strengths in this project were explaining my code and my thought processes although I did struggle with using Eclipse. 
If I could go back I would fix up issues within my code.
Interpreting the users needs was an important aspect to the project, so I brainstormed various additions that could be made to the finished product to better enhance user experience and usability across multiple platforms.
